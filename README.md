Hi, my name is Angelo Ace Arnisto. I am a System Equipment Engineer from ADI Cavite. I am passionate about 
Programming. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited to meet 
you and learn more about you.

playing with programs/codes
watching netflix
reading trivias and articles of my interest
playing mobile games

My goal for this year is to finish my study in refocus. Also to have resign on my current employment and become a web developer on a big company that will use my skill that I have learned at refocus.


I find it to be a challenging and rewarding puzzle to figure out how to get a computer to do what I want it to do. I'm able to learn new things quickly and easily. I'm always interested in learning about new technologies and how they can be used to solve problems.
